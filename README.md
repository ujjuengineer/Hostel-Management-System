Hostel Management System using Django and Bootstrap


**Info**

This project was developed as a semester academic project as part of my coursework at Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology (MMMUT).
The objective of the project was to design and implement an efficient solution for the given problem while applying core concepts of Django.

HostelConnect is a modern, web-based hostel management system developed using Django and Bootstrap. It simplifies hostel operations by digitizing student data, rent management, and visitor communication, while offering a clean, responsive UI suitable for mobile and desktop use.

The system is designed to manage student accommodation effectively, providing a reliable interface for both administrators and hostel residents. Visitors can explore facilities and submit contact inquiries, while students can log in to manage complaints and view personal details.
